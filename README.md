# comp3005project
PostgreSQL final database project for COMP3005 Winter 2020. 

The app is composed of two layers - the JS/HTML front end, and the Postgres back end. Essentially, the purpose of the web app is so that the user can interact with the back end through SQL queries that are triggered through pressing buttons, moving items around, etc.
